title: What is 109?

You might be wondering why this site is name *"I Teach 109"*. What is so special
about the number 109? Is it a reference to something? Is it a code? Is it an
inside joke? What is the deal here?

The answer is actually very simple. 109 is the old the old course number for 
*Fluency in Technology*. This designation is now defunct, but before
it was rebranded as CSIT-100 in the fall of 2014, the course used to be 
labeled CMPT-109. This is how most students knew and referred to it throughout
most of my MSU teaching career.

When the name of the course changed, I decided to keep the name of the blog,
both for consistency, and because it sounded better than *"I Teach 100"*.
